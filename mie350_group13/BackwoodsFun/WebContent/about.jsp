		Backwoods Fun Club is a community sport web application that assists users with 
		the organization of community intramural hockey games. Most intramural leagues are 
		run through institutions such as schools or work-places. Our system allows users to 
		join intramural leagues without having to be a part of a third party organization. 
		Our web application will organize its leagues by geographical locations and will allow 
		users to search for leagues and games within their area. This will make it easy for 
		users to locate intramural leagues within their community. <br> <br> 
		It was developed using the following:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers,</li>
			<li>The Java programming language,</li>
			<li>Java Server Pages (JSP),</li>
			<li>Apache Tomcat 7.0, and</li>
			<li>A simple Microsoft Access database.</li>
